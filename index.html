                <p>Hello! My name is Daisy Buchanan, welcome to my blog. I am young women coming from Louisville, Kentucky, now I live in New-york, East Egg. I am married to Tom Buchanan. Back in my young-unmarried days I was a debutante at, Louisville. As a matter of fact I was a popular debutante; especially around the military men popular, I was. I remember back then I was with Mr Jay Gatsby. He said he came from a rich family like me. But the poor man was taken to fight faraway.</p>
                <p>As time passed I move on. Doddered-and-dithered, Continuing on my debutante business; Until I met Tom. The same Tom I married. The same Tom whom gifted me a beautiful pearler neckless, so many year ago. Tom he is a young man from a solid, aristocratic family who could promise the world to me, and who my parents liked more. Coming back to the present day: I was was reunited with Nick my cosine as he move to East egg work in the bond business. No wander, he didn’t change much; I rememberer him a this boring man who very much is just present. He had nothing to add. That why the bond business fit him; it’s just a means to an end.</p>
                <p>But recently Nick had been more active. He somehow got a hold of Gatsby! Apparently Nick wan invited one of Gatsby, Big parties he had been hosting, which I didn’t know of for some reason. Gatsby moved to East egg and lived right across the lake. And natural it was just a matter of time till my ‘old-friend’ invited me over to see his new estate.</p>

                <h2>My Visit to Gatby's Mansion</h2>

                    <p>The Exterior</p>
                </div>


                <p>Gatsby’s new Mansion was gargantuan as big as our, or maybe even bigger! He showed me around; the whole house was splendid, a sight to see. Especially a room filled with shirts! Such beautiful, luxurious fabrics, all from London, he said. When he pulled them out, one by one, and threw them around I simply started to cry, it was such a powerful moment. Such a powerful moment to be remembered. That man really went far to make such an impression. After all, what a grand gesture! Though, I never knew he was such a showman. It's almost too much, I guess. It makes me wonder. But still, the house was beautiful, the whole place so lavish, a real piece of art. The garden was immaculate, with a beautiful blue lawn and fountains all around, very green and very neat. Everything was perfect, and he even had a small beach and a dock, so close to the water. The whole thing was just too much for me, I suppose. I was so overwhelmed with it all, with the memories, with the sheer size and opulence. It was a lot to take in.</p>

                </div>


                <p>We talked, too, of course. About the past, about Louisville, about the war. He told me he was an Oxford man. But I was still thinking about those beautiful shirts, those beautiful, beautiful shirts. I remember him telling me he did it all for me, all this success, all this show was for me. I remember him looking at me with those deep, yearning eyes, full of something I couldn't quite place, but it was something. He even offered me to come to one of his parties, he hosts them every weekend, the biggest parties, with such a crowd of people I couldn't imagine. I might go, I suppose. Maybe I should see what the fuss is about. I'm sure it'll be a thrill. After all, Nick is going, and he’s changed a bit, maybe I should change, too. Maybe it is time for a little thrill in my life. A little change of scenery. I should bring Jordan, too, she'd love it. She'd love the crowd, the music, the energy. It would be a dream. I'm sure I'll have a wonderful time. I deserve it, after all.</p>
